## Quality of Life Home
### Project Description & Rationale

We chose to focus our topic on the impact of legal protections on the quality of life within countries on an international level. We chose to select this topic because of our own personal experiences with discrimination towards our own genders and sexual orientations, as well as our deep interest in the topic and how it varies on an international scale. We focused on how the implementation of these laws correlates with the quality of life in the 185 countries listed, including variables such as happiness score and satisfaction with GDP per capita. 

Our research questions include: investigating how the Sexual Orientation & Gender Index (SOGI) of a country correlate with the happiness score of that country, how the happiness score differs among a traditionally individualistic continent such as North America, vs. a traditionally collectivist continent such as Asia, the correlation between Predominant Religion and Happiness levels as it pertains to quality of life, and how the freedom to make life choices affect levels of happiness between countries. We also investigated the distribution of major religions by continent as well as descriptive statistics among happiness scores from The World Happiness Report and the legality of same-sex marriage on a 1-point scale. 
### Significance

Our group was interested in understanding sexual orientation and gender identity laws and the way they impact people on a global scale. We analyzed the SOGI-LI index and the way it intersects with issues represented in our dataset such as happiness, religious freedoms, and freedom to make life choices, to name a few. This project poses important questions about the degree to which one’s gender and sexual orientation provides them equal rights by comparing country-level data. The SOGI-LI seeks to measure how various countries’ governments and laws help international development and people with different sexual orientation and gender identities live in equality and safety. The higher the score of the SOGI-LI Index, the more rights are guaranteed to the members of a particular area by law (i.e., to freely embarace their sexual orientation and gender identity). This project sheds light on each country’s standards to promote and are committed to development and providing equal rights to their people. It informs readers about the degree to which laws restrict their right to live in equality and safety – examining marriage & civil union, antidiscrimination laws, legality of same-sex sexual activity, and happiness levels, by country. Our goal is to increase awareness about the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities that would hopefully ameliorate the quality and effectiveness of public policy. 

### Audience

We imagine people who are passionate about the legality of same-sex marriage and other SOGI-related protections to interact with our project. Although our project looks at sexual orientation and gender from a broad lens, readers can still benefit in examining key differences regarding how liberal countries are towards these topics and the quality of life among people residing in those countries. This project answers questions related to how impactful and important freedom of gender and sexual expression are, while taking into account the many confounding factors that play a part in the quality of life in a country. We are cognizant of the many different cultural and economic factors that play a huge role in determining quality of life. Thus, we take these considerations into account while also answering the questions mentioned above.

### Technical Specifications

We are using R and Tableau to execute our analytical methods and analysis. Both of these programming languages come equipped with comprehensive packages to aid in the understanding of our data and analysis. R gives us the ability to make simple and complex mathematical and statistical calculations. Meanwhile, software like Tableau allows us to create complex and interactive data visualizations to interpret our dataset and present a compelling narrative. We chose Tableau specifically because we wanted to include more complex, detailed representations of our data. As for our dataset, we used Google Sheets to share it amongst our group members. We have a folder with our cleaned dataset, research questions, and other relevant information about our dataset shared among all our group members on Google Sheets and Doc sharing platform for easy access. 

### Data Selection
We selected the dataset Sexual Orientation and Gender-Identity (SOGI) Laws That Support and/or Limit International Development, conducted by Thomas S. Serwatka of the University of North Florida, published in 2020. We scraped the data into google sheets so that the two partnered groups could have collaborative access to the cleaned file. We did not remove any observations from the sheets, partly due to the low number of observations (185) included in the dataset. This dataset was published in 2020, but indexes which were collected from various research institutions date as far back as 2012. For example Educational Level Data was collected in 2017, while the Predominant Major Religious Group data was collected in 2012 by the Pew Research Center. We made the choice to keep all indexes included in the dataset because we originally were grouped into 3 sections, split between SOGILI & Quality of Life, SOGILI & Personal Freedoms, and SOGILI & Religiosity. We ended up just merging into two groups by dissolving the latter, so we kept all the variables originally included in the dataset. 

### Description of work plan 

For our Chi-Square test analysis, we chose to conduct a Fisher’s Exact test to run an exact procedure for our sample size. We originally chose the Chi-Square Test, but since our expected values had a frequency less than 5, we decided that running a Fisher’s Exact test would be best suited for analyzing our variables. The Fisher’s Exact Test allowed us to simulate the p-value since the workspace wasn’t large enough to go through all possible permutations. We analyzed the correlation between predominant religion and happiness levels as it pertains to quality of life. Using R, we ran a contingency table to break down high and low levels of happiness and predominant religions prevalent globally. Each of us ran the code to mutate happiness levels into low and high values using the code provided in lecture. We then ran a Fisher’s Exact test, which indicated a p-value of 0.1599 – greater than the significance level of 0.05. 

In our outcome table,  we analyzed the variables for continents based on the SOGI-LI Index. We chose to analyze outcome tables based on continents, so we could identify how many countries were within each continent. Thus, we were able to identify notable differences when we compared continents based on the SOGI-LI index. In our contingency table, we focused on the variables of predominant religion and continents. Although our research questions center around the quality of life, we discovered that many of our variables were quantitative values, which prompted us to use a contingency table to further explore. R allowed us to create an outcome table giving us values for continents (i.e., Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Oceana). Further, R allowed us to create a contingency table giving us values that indicate the prevalence of specific religions in each continent (i.e., Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Indigenous. Judaism, Islam, None, and Unknown). 

Our ANOVA analysis examined the variables of freedom to make life choices and happiness levels by country. These variables were chosen to examine since our research questions centered around gender identity and sexual orientation as it pertains to quality of life. We sought to determine the extent to which the freedom to make life choices affects a country’s overall happiness levels (e.g., low vs. high). Our ANOVA test determined whether there was a significant relationship between low and high levels of happiness and the freedom to make life choices. After running our ANOVA test, we went on to conduct a Post-Hoc Test to discern which happiness level means were statistically significant. We then performed three diagnostic checking tests to solidify the reliability of our ANOVA tests – ensuring a valid analysis. We conducted an independence, equality of variance, and normality checking test. We used R to create a Q-Q plot with a regression line which thus determined the reliability of our ANOVA test.

### Findings

With our Fisher’s Exact test, we found that the p-value came out to be 0.1599, which went above the significance level of 0.05 and therefore is not statistically significant. What this means is that there was not strong enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that predominant religion and happiness are independent. Therefore, we are able to suggest that predominant religion and happiness may be independent of one another. The importance of these findings within the context of our research questions tells us that there is there is a potential quality of life, including freedoms that are related or adjacent to same-sex freedoms, that may play a larger role in indicating happiness levels instead of just the predominant religion of a country. In other words, it indicates that the religious ties of a country do not necessarily dictate how happy the people of that country will be.

In our outcome table, we found notable differences in the SOGI-LI index by comparing continents based on the SOGI-LI index. By analyzing the outcome table based on continents, we were able to identify how many countries are within each continent. Thus, we were able to find that Africa and Europe had the largest distribution of countries based on continents. Additionally, we found that America and Oceania have the smallest distribution of countries based on continents. Furthermore, for our contingency table, we found that Christianity was the most common religion among all continents. However, our findings indicated that Asia’s most common religion was Islam. This finding was important in terms of our study, because it illustrates how beliefs about gender and sexuality are often tied to religion, and these thoughts vary between religions. A key thing to note is that a high number of countries is not indicative of a high population. For example, we found that Africa overwhelmingly has a lower number of Muslim-majority countries in comparison to the number of Christian-majority countries. However, this doesn’t take into account the populations within Africa, and how Muslim-majority countries might be more populated.

Following our ANOVA test, we found that our F statistic value came out to be 0.23. The F statistic measures the total variances between the two measured variables, freedom to make life choices and happiness. Being that our F value is less than the critical F value at 3.92, it tells us that we fail to reject the null hypothesis that states the variance in the freedom to make life choices and happiness levels between countries are independent of one another. What this means is that the variance between the freedom to make life choices and happiness levels are instead dependent on one another. In the context of our research questions, these findings suggest that countries that allow more freedoms among people’s lifestyle, including sexuality, are more likely to report higher happiness scores.

### Conclusion

In summary, we chose to study the impact of leal protections on the quality of life on an international scale, in regards to sexual orientation and gender freedom. We investigated how indexes such as the Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity Law Index (SOGI-LI) correlated with happiness levels and other variables. This project is significant because of how the dataset uses various socioeconomic factors to measure SOGI-LI, and provide impactful data on gender and sexual orientation equality on a global scale. We imagine anyone who is passionate about equality in regards to sexual orientation and gender expression to potentially interact with our project. We are using R and Tableau to execute our data analysis and statistical calculations. We also used google drive and sheets to stay collaborative within the different sub-groups. We selected the dataset,  Sexual Orientation and Gender-Identity (SOGI) Laws That Support and/or Limit International Development, conducted by Thomas S. Serwatka of the University of North Florida (2020). The dataset includes 185 observations with variables collected between the time period from 2012 to 2020. 

For our workplan, we chose the analytical approaches of the chi-square test, fishers exact test, outcome table, and an ANOVA analysis to measure the relationship the variables related to quality of life and sexual orientation and gender on an international scale. From Fisher's exact test we found that predominant religion and happiness may be independent of each other. We also found notable differences among continents in terms of predominant religion from our outcome tables. We also found the freedom to make life choices and happiness levels are dependent on each other from our ANOVA analysis. With these major findings, we can conclude that there is an effect on quality of life and SOGI-LI.
